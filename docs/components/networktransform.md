# Introduction
The synchronization of an object's transform is one of the most common netcode tasks performed in multiplayer games today. The concept seems simple:
- Determine which transform axis you want to have synchronized
- Serialize the values
- Send the serialized values as messages to all other connected clients
- Process the messages and deserialize the values
- Apply the values to the appropriate axis

At first pass glance the high level outlined tasks seem relatively simple, but when you start to implement each line item almost any veteran netcode software engineer will agree: _It can become complicated very quickly_.

The above itemized tasks exclude things like:
- Who controls the synchronization (i.e. each client or the server or perhaps both depending upon the object being synchronized)?
- How often do you synchronize the values and what logic should you use to determine when the values need to be synchronized?
  - If you have wide time gaps between synchronization, how do you smooth out the motion on the receiving side?
- If you have a complex parenting hierarchy (parents with children transforms), do you want to synchronize the world or local space axis values?
  - If you have complex axis values (i.e. a parent with a world space rotation and a child with a local space rotation), can you use Euler values (or better yet, should you use Euler values).
- Ultimately, you might arrive to the most common question: How can I optimize the bandwidth cost per transform update?

Fortunately, NGO provides you with (albeit opinionated) a NetworkTransform component that helps you to reduce time spent solving for some of the trickier aspects of transform synchronization while providing you with a set of properties that allows you to customize what portions of the transform you want synchronized, whether it will synchronize world or local space axis values, the kind of bandwidth optimizations you would like to used, and define what instance (client/owner or server) will be in control of the synchronization of the axis values.

# NetworkTransform 

## Adding
When adding a NetworkTransform component to a GameObject, you should always make sure the GameObject has a NetworkObject component attached to it or that the GameObject's transform parent is assigned to a GameObject with a NetworkObject component attached to it like in the image below:
![image](images/NetworkTransformSimple.png)

You can also have a parent GameObject that has a NetworkObject component attached to it with a child GameObject that has a NetworkTransform component like in the image below:
![image](images/NetworkTransformSimpleParent.png)

You can also have "nested NetworkTransforms" that are all associated with a single NetworkObject like in the image below:
![image](images/NetworkTransformNestedParent.png)

:::tip
**The general rule to follow is:**
 
 As long as there is at least one (1) NetworkObject at the same GameObject hierarchical level or above, you can attach a NetworkTransform component to a GameObject. 
 
 _You could have a single root-parent GameObject that has a NetworkObject component and under the root-parent several levels of nested child GameObjects that all have NetworkTransform components attached to them. Each child GameObject would not require a NetworkObject component in order for each respective NetworkTransform component to function/synchronize properly._

## Configuring
Properties
![image](images/NetworkTransformProperties.png)


The position, rotation, and scale of a [`NetworkObject`](../basics/networkobject.md) is normally only synchronized once (when that object spawns). To synchronize position, rotation, and scale at real-time during the game, you must use a `NetworkTransform` component. `NetworkTransform` synchronizes the transform from server object to the clients.

`NetworkTransform` covers most use cases for synchronizing transforms. For some special cases, such as fast paced games, a custom implementation with a different interpolation algorithm might be better.

:::tip

You can have more than one `NetworkTransform` components on child objects of your network object to synchronize individual positions of child objects.

:::

# Restricting synchronization

You often don't need to synchronize all transform values of a GameObject over the network. For instance, if the scale of the GameObject never changes, you can deactivate it in the **syncing scale** row in the Inspector. Deactivating synchronization saves CPU costs and network bandwidth.

# Thresholds

You can use the threshold values to set a minimum threshold value. Whether to scale to your project's world unit scale or to reduce the frequency of synchronization updates, changes below threshold values won't synchronize. For example, if your `NetworkTransform` has `Interpolate` enabled, you might find that you can lower your position threshold resolution (position threshold value increased) without impacting the "smoothness" of an object's motion. Increasing the threshold value (lowering the resolution of synchronization updates) reduces the frequency of when the object's position synchronize (which translates to reducing bandwidth consumption).

:::note

The small changes below the threshold still result in a synchronization of the values as soon as all the accumulative changes cross the threshold.

:::

# Local space

By default, `NetworkTransform` synchronizes the transform of an object in world space. The **In Local Space** configuration option allows you to change to synchronizing the transform in local space instead.

Using **local space** can improve the synchronization of the transform when the object gets re-parented because the re-parenting won't change the **local space** transform of the object but does change the **global space** position.

# Interpolation

Check the `Interpolate` setting to enable interpolation. Interpolation is enabled by default and is highly recommended. With interpolation enabled, the `NetworkTransform` interpolates incoming changes to position, rotation, and scale. Interpolation also buffers the incoming data with a slight delay and applies extra smoothing to the values. All these factors combined result in a much smoother transform synchronization.

When you have `Interpolate` disabled, changes to the transform immediately apply, resulting in a less smooth position and more jitter.

:::note

The `NetworkTransform` component only interpolates client-side. For smoother movement on the host or server, users might want to implement interpolation server-side as well. While the server won't have the jitter caused by the network, some stutter can still happen locally (for example, movement done in `FixedUpdate` with a low physics update rate).

## ClientNetworkTransform

`NetworkTransform` always synchronizes positions from the server to the clients and position changes on the clients aren't allowed. Netcode for GameObjects comes with a sample containing a `ClientNetworkTransform`. This transform synchronizes the position of the owner client to the server and all other client allowing for client authoritative gameplay.

You can use the existing `ClientNetworkTransform` in the Multiplayer Samples Utilities package.<br />

To add the Multiplayer Samples Utilities package:

* Open the Package Manager by selecting **Window** > **Package Manager**.
* Select **Add** (+) > **Add from git URLâ€¦**.
* Copy and paste the following Git URL: `https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop.git?path=/Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop#main`
* Select **Add**.

Optionally, you can directly add this line to your `manifest.json` file:

`"com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop": "https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop.git?path=/Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop#main"`

You can also create your own `ClientNetworkTransform` by deriving from `NetworkTransform`, overriding the `OnIsServerAuthoritative` virtual method, and returning false:

```csharp reference

```
